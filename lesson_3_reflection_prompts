When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to make a simple text file, it could be easier doing it through the website.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because maybe you are not the only person that uses this repository and there might be problems because of that.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - copy repositories only on GitHub, clone - can copy repository from GitHub or from the computer, branch - different version in the same repository.
