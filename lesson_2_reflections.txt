What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You don't need to do anything but you can write git status to see what files do you have.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is just a step before making a commit, it is a place to list which files you want to use as one commit. The value is that you can clearly see what goes into one commit.
